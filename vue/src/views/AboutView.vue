    <p class="description">I am a software engineer based in Columbus, Ohio. My fascination with forlorn, haunting, and ___ spaces began
      as a child growing up in the old mill towns that freckle the New England landscape. Decades past their expiration and subsequent
      abandonment, hidden behind the architectural failure we know as the strip mall, there were the old mills, their character 
      undisturbed. Their presence evoked something in me, I'm not sure I'd call them feelings, but I wasn't sure what to call it.
