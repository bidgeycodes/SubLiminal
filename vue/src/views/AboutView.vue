    <p class="description">I am a software engineer based in Columbus, Ohio. My fascination with forlorn, haunting, and deserted spaces began
      as a child growing up in abandoned mill towns that freckle the New England landscape. Being in such presences stirred something within me;
      senses of apprehension, uneasiness, but also a surreal and comforting aura. It wasn't until I encountered the concept of a <span class="italicize">
      liminal space</span> that I could put a name to my sensory experiences. I was making contact with a metaphysical boundary between the
      familiar yet unfamiliar, the temporality of time and space, the abandoned past and an unknown future.</p>
    <p class="descrption">The images in this collection are years worth of encounters in spaces potent enough for me to reach for my phone and
      remember them. All images displayed were captured very unprofessionally via an iPhone camera, without editing by yours truly unless otherwise
      noted.</p>
    <p class="description">Thank you to everyone who pushed me and supported me in this project, especially those who said, "yeah, that seems cool."</p>
